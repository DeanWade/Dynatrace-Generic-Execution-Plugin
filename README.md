The Generic Execution Plugin executes any configurable command or web service.
It can be used as a Monitor, Task or Action depending on if a measurement should be received, a task should be regularly performed or a command/web service should be executed in case of an incident.
If used as a monitor it matches the command's/web service's output against a regular expression and simply returns a success state if a match was found.
